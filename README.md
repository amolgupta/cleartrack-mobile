# ClearTrack

This is a Kotlin multiplatform demo project. I have been using this project to test out new Android and Kotlin features for learning. The motivation is to use a near production app to learn stuff rather than use a simple tutorial for each library.

The app is available on [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.getclear.app). The backend runs is built with Django using this [cookiecutter](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django) and is hosted on heroku with a micro instance.
This was previously a normal Android project and in a different repository and commits do not go all the way back. Some code has not been moved yet (like all test cases)
